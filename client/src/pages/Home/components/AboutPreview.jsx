          <p className="about-text">
            Legist is a legal-tech platform built to improve access to justice,
            transparency, and lawyer–client collaboration across India.
          </p>
          <p className="about-text">
            Developed by a small team of students who believe the legal system
            should feel navigable, not intimidating — for everyone, not just
            those who already speak its language.
